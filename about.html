      <p class="about-page__text">Greeting is a form of communication in which people deliberately acknowledge one another's presence. It signals attention, sets the tone of an encounter, and hints at the relationship or social distance between those who meet- whether formal, informal, intimate, or restrained. Greeting customs are shaped by culture and context, and they often shift within the same society depending on status, familiarity, and situation. Still, some kind of greeting exists in every known human culture.</p>
      <p class="about-page__text">This website explores seven common body based greeting gestures through three lenses: a short written description, a series of images, and a unique shape for each gesture, generated by a custom shape system built on a fixed set of criteria.</p>
