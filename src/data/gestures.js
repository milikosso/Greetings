    description: 'La bise is the common French greeting involving cheek kisses, a customary gesture of affection and respect among friends, family, and acquaintances, varying in the number of kisses (usually one to four) and region, involving light cheek touches and air kisses rather than actual lip contact. It\'s used when meeting and leaving, acting as a cultural norm, and can be slightly awkward due to differing regional rules and personal styles, with two kisses (one per cheek) being very common, especially in Paris.',

    title: 'Waving',
    description: 'Waving is a non-contact greeting in which a person raises a hand and moves it side to side (or lifts it briefly) to acknowledge someone, signaling recognition without entering the other person\'s space. It\'s widely used between strangers, acquaintances, and friends, especially in public settings where speaking or approaching isn\'t practical. The meaning shifts with context: a small restrained wave can feel polite and respectful, while a bigger wave can feel excited, playful, or celebratory. Because it works across distances and cultures, waving often functions as a simple, universal opener.',

    description: 'The wai is a traditional Thai greeting performed by pressing the palms together in front of the chest (or face) and slightly bowing the head, used to show respect, gratitude, or apology as well as to say hello and goodbye. It is closely tied to social hierarchy: the higher the hands and the deeper the bow, the more respect is expressed, and typically the younger or lower-status person initiates while the other returns it. The wai can feel graceful and formal, but it also requires cultural awareness to avoid uncertainty. Because it is non-contact and carefully coded, the wai can feel graceful and composed. It turns greeting into a small ritual of attentiveness and mutual recognition.',

    description: 'A hug as a greeting involves two people stepping into close proximity and wrapping their arms around each other, bringing bodies into contact as a sign of affection, comfort, or closeness. It\'s common among friends, family, and partners, and in many places it can replace or accompany other greetings. The meaning of a greeting hug depends on details- length, pressure, whether it\'s one-armed or a full embrace, so it can range from quick and casual to deeply supportive, but also might be awkward when intimacy levels don\'t match. At its core, it communicates warmth and presence.',

    description: 'Hand kissing is a greeting in which one person takes another\'s hand, traditionally a woman\'s, an elder\'s, or a person of higher status, and brings it toward the lips, often touching the hand lightly or miming the kiss as a gesture of respect, admiration, or courtly politeness. It appears in certain European, Middle Eastern, and ceremonial contexts, and today it can feel old-fashioned, theatrical, or formal, used more in special occasions than everyday life. Because it carries strong signals of gender, hierarchy, and etiquette, hand kissing can read as charming to some and uncomfortable or patronizing to others, depending on consent, setting, and tone. When welcomed, it can feel flattering and distinctly celebratory.',
